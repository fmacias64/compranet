# Abstract

*Since 2002, the Mexican Federal government handles most of its procurement biddings through a transactional platform called Compranet. Even though most of the information in the platform is public, authorities and organizations dedicated to fight corruption do not have a technical framework to better allocate their resources into cases.*

*Our project consisted in developing an interactive dashboard for investigators to track particular contracts and to filter out low-risk cases.*
